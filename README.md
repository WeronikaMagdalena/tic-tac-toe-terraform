## Reflections

- What did you learn?
    Patience
- What obstacles did you overcome?
    Nothing working.
- What did you help most in overcoming obstacles?
    Following the example of the lab for running basic app in the instance and applying those steps
    for my application.
- Was that something that surprised you?
    That after doing it once it is actually quite easy but to do it for the first time it takes ages.
